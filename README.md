# Project 2: Narrative tree

> “I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”

In this project you will create several scenes from a larger branching story we will create in class. Your scene will consist of a single webpage (HTML, CSS and images) that links to and is linked from other students' work. Because of this, you shouldn't change the plot or basic outline of the story. 

You can, however, expand on details and set the tone for the scene. The story is the script and your are the director/cinematographer interpreting the story. How can your page unfold over time for the reader? Is it a shock or a subtle realization? Is it humorous or tragic? Do they have to wait or do you present everything right away? 

You will use this repository which contains the basic structure of the story as your base. Next week in class we learn how to use GIT to combined our various parts into a single work.

You will be assigned **TWO scenes** from the story. Download this repository. Each scene from the story has a folder labeled A through R. You can use the index.html file in that folder to build your document. Include any images and CSS you would like to include. If you need help setting up the basics of your HTML look to the index.html file in the main repository directory.

Your scene needs to give the user the choices that lead them to the next scenes, as shown in the diagram. You can link to these other scenes by either using "/A/index.html" or "/A/". When pointing to a directory browswer automatically look for index.html.

Post any questions to the Slack.
